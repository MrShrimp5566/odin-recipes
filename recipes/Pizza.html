        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup lukewarm water</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water that's 110 degrees F (44 degrees C) in a small bowl. Let stand until 
                yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine 1 3/4 cups flour and salt in a large bowl. 
                Pour in yeast mixture; mix well until dough comes together.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth, 
                about 2 minutes. Add remaining 1/4 cup flour if dough is too sticky.</li>
            <li>Roll dough into a 12-inch circle. Transfer to a greased pizza pan.</li>
            <li>Top the crust as desired and bake at 500 degrees F &#40;260 degrees C&#41; until golden, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
